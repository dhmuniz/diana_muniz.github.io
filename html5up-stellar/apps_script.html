								<h2>Objective</h2>
								<p>To take a time-intensive manual process and implement an automated system using Google Apps Script.  This project aimed to enhance efficiency, minimize expired leads, and improve data collection by using technology to streamline our current process. </p>
								
								<h2>My Role</h2>
								<p>In response to a collaborative challenge presented by a fellow manager, my role centered on strategically assessing and streamlining the expired lead feedback process.  I was able to research ways to automate this within the scope of my position and developed a Google Apps Script that innovatively leveraged technological tools that we had available in my position to create a more efficient workflow and foster a more collaborative spirit amongst teams.</p>
								
								<h2>Technologies Involved</h2>
								<p>This project leveraged the versatile capabilities of Google Workspace, specifically utilizing Google Forms to collect user input, Google Sheets for data management and analysis, and Google Apps Script for automating processes and workflows.  </p>
								<p>Google Apps Script, which is based on JavaScript, served as the backbone of our solution, enabling the seamless integration of these technologies and the automation of email communications.</p>
								
								<h2>Process</h2>
								<p>In navigating the constraints set by our Group Policy, I set out to identify a viable solution within our operational parameters.  My process began with research, including leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT, to understand our options.  After identifying Google Apps Script as our most viable option due to its compatibility and integration with our existing infrastructure, I developed a script while maintaining open lines of communication with stakeholders and seeking iterative feedback, which was crucial in refining the script to its final, efficient form.</p>
								
								<h2>Outcomes</h2>
								<p>The automation of this process resulted in a significant increase of operational efficiency, evidenced by a 75% decrease in expired leads over the first month it was in place.  The success was largely due to the targeted coaching enabled by the detailed data the new system provided.  By simplifying the process, we achieved higher adherence from managers, directly improving agent feedback and data collection.  Furthermore, the data collected allowed us to identify trends and proactively address periods with potential increase in expired leads, further increasing efficiency.</p>
