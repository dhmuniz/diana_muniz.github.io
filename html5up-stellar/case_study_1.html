								<h2>Challenge</h2>
								<p>In our insurance enrollment process, inefficient handling of expired leads posed significant challenges. Agents frequently encountered leads that hadnâ€™t been properly statused, leading to confusion and inefficiency. This not only hampered the agents' ability to effectively follow up but also adversely impacted their performance metrics. The existing process required managers to manually identify responsible agents and draft up communication across teams or departments, which was time-consuming and often resulted in untracked and underutilized data.</p>
								
								<h2>Role and Goals</h2>
								<p>As a key player in the project, my role involved analyzing the existing lead management process, identifying bottlenecks, and devising a streamlined approach. My primary goals were to reduce the time spent by managers in handling expired leads, ensure accurate tracking and reporting of lead status issues, and improve the overall efficiency and data utilization in the lead management system.  </p>
								<p>My theory was that if we could streamline this process, we could increase manager adherence to the process, and if we could collect good data we could identify coaching opportunities, and reduce the impact this issue had overall.</p>

								
								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>To address these challenges, I developed an automated system.  The new process only required managers to fill out a simple form with just the lead ID and the agent's name.  This form, integrated with Google Apps Script, automatically updated a Google Sheet with pertinent details, identified the agent's manager, and triggered a customized email to both the agent and manager, including a refresher guide on proper lead statusing.  Additionally, the sheet was equipped with a dynamic graph displaying daily expired lead volumes and auto-generated reports highlighting top agents and managers with expired lead issues.</p>
								<h2> Outcome and Results</h2>
								<p>The implementation of this automated lead management system led to remarkable outcomes.  We observed a drastic reduction in the volume of expired leads, as evidenced by the real-time graph.  We were also able to predict times when we could naturally expect higher expired lead volume and be proactive in handling it. </p>
								<p>The system's ability to automatically generate key reports provided invaluable insights, leading to proactive management and training interventions. The streamlined process significantly reduced the time managers spent on expired leads, enhancing overall departmental productivity and adherence to the procedure. This system not only improved operational efficiency, but also increased the accuracy of agent performance metrics.</p></p>
