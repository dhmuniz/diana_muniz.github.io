								<h2>Challenge</h2>
								<p>Managers were spending excessive time pulling reporting to monitor their agents' real-time KPI throughout the day.  The process was extremely inefficient, and with so many people pulling the same BI reports continuously it created system strain, which led reporting to crash regularly. This caused delays in visibility, and more work for our BI partners.</p>
								
								<h2>Role and Goals</h2>
								<p>Seeing an opportunity to streamline our process and allow team members to focus on more impactful tasks, I took the initiative to find a more practical solution within the scope of my role.  My goals were to devise a more efficient method of tracking daily performance metrics that could save managers' time, centralize data access, and enhance the performance and reliability of our systems.  </p>
								<p>Building on the idea that a unified tracker could expedite the process and foster better data integrity and accessibility, I set out to develop a solution that could meet these needs.</p></p>
								
								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>I created a regional tracker that served as a centralized hub for the data we needed to track our key performance metrics.  This innovative approach allowed for streamlined access to data, where managers could no extract all necessary reports from a singular, reliable source.  I worked with upper leadership to get the new system adopted on a regional level, then worked with my peers to show them how to set their individual team trackers up to automatically update with the regional tracker.</p>
								
								<h2> Outcome and Results</h2>
								<p>The implementation of a centralized tracker for performance data had a significant impact on manager efficiency, saving more than 21 man-hours a week.  Not only did we see a substantial reduction in the time dedicated to pulling reports, and it also reduced the frequency of system crashes due to decreased strain on our reporting servers.  It allowed upper management visibility on up-to-date numbers while alleviating the need for them to engage in the task of pulling the reports themselves, and it allowed agents more frequent updates on their progress.  This new process enabled our region to operate with heightened efficiency and agility. </p>
